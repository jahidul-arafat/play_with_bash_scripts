PART-1: What I have tried when my Containers were not connecting to internet
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) To check whether the DNS server is working properly: NSLOOKUP
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. sudo yum install bind-utils
2. nslookup mirrorlist.centos.org  # here I have used it, when I have found that my containers cant ping to internet
3. nslookup lab1.harriswebworks.com
4. nslookup lab2.harriswebworks.com

(b) Check the /etc/resolv.conf file, if you edit it then must restart the network
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. sudo vim /etc/resolv.conf
6. sudo systemctl restart network

(c) Checked out some network-scripts and tried to edit some for the solution, though those didnt worked and didnt solved the problem
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. ip a s           #---> to check at which network interface I am connected
8. sudo vim /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
