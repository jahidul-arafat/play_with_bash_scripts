Problem Faced

The task was to create a accufmdev sftp user having access only to the 
/home/accustandard/public_html/pub/media/docshare which is owned by accustandard:accustandard.

> I have tested the solution using "ChrootDirectory %h", but everytime I tried with the ChrootDirectroy, I received the following error in the FileZilla Connection:
Error: "FATAL ERROR: Remote Server unexpectedly closed network connection"

Then I tried the solution in a different way. 
Instead of using Jail Choot, I used the following procedure

(1) Create user accufmdev
> useradd accufmdev -s /sbin/nologin
> passwd accufmdev
> usermod -aG accustandard accufmdev // add the user into the accustandard group, as the folder we have to be shared in under the accustandard ownership

(2) Check the permissions of accufmdev (user+group permission)
> ls -ld /home/accufmdev/
drwx------ 3 accufmdev accufmdev 19 Mar 30 10:00 /home/accufmdev/

(3) Create a directory named media in /home/accufmdev
> mkdir /home/accufmdev/media
# as u are logged in as root, by default the /home/accufmdev/media will have the following permissions:
    >> root:root
    >> 755
(4) Change the permissions to accustandard:accustandard and 770
    > chown accustandard:accustandard /home/accufmdev/media
    > chmod 770 home/accufmdev/media
(5) mount the /home/accustandard/public_html/pub/media directory to /home/accufmdev/media
    > mount -o bind /home/accustandard/public_html/pub/media/docshare /home/accufmdev/media
(6) Now check the filepermission and ownership of /home/accufmdev/media
    > ls -ld /home/accufmdev/media 
    drwxrwxrwx+ 28 accustandard accustandard 4096 Mar 30 10:24 /home/accufmdev/media

(7) Now edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file

---------------------------------------------------------------
Subsystem       sftp    /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server -l INFO

Match User accufmdev
        #ChrootDirectory %h
        ForceCommand internal-sftp
        X11Forwarding no
        AllowTcpForwarding no
---------------------------------------------------------------
> systemctl restart sshd

(9) Now finally use the "sites-accufmdev.xml"
or use the following information

--------------------
Host: 34.196.7.190
Port: 6666
User: accufmdev
Pass:
