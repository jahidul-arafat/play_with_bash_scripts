From Link: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/203846/how-to-sync-two-folders-with-command-line-tools
This puts folder A into folder B:
---------------------------------
> rsync -avu --delete "/home/user/A" "/home/user/B"  

If you want the contents of folders A and B to be the same, put /home/user/A/ (with the slash) as the source. This takes not the folder A but all of it's content and puts it into folder B. Like this:

> rsync -avu --delete "/home/user/A/" "/home/user/B"
    -a Do the sync preserving all filesystem attributes
    -v run verbosely
    -u only copy files with a newer modification time (or size difference if the times are equal)
    --delete delete the files in target folder that do not exist in the source
